				I am a Web Developer + Mechanical Engineer from the Philippines. The <strong class="text-xl">critical, disciplined, and holistic mindset</strong> molded by engineering has lead me to venture into data visualization and web development. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the past 2 years after graduating and passing the engineering licensure exam, I have worked as a freelancer in various industries, and shortly as a 3D CAD modeler. I am a <strong class="text-xl">team player</strong> by nature and also reliable and effective in working independently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently doing full stack web development. I do projects with <strong class="text-xl">Python as backend, serverless, and Vue.js/Nuxt.js</strong> frontend projects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Presently working at <strong class="text-xl">Horizon Agency Systems</strong> (based in Colorado, USA) as a remote Web Developer.

			<p>
				Most importantly, I am an <strong class="text-xl">international volunteer</strong> helping all sorts of people to learn and benefit from <strong class="text-xl">God's Word.</strong>
