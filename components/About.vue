				I am a Web Developer + Mechanical Engineer from the Philippines. The <strong class="text-xl">critical, disciplined, and holistic mindset</strong> molded by engineering has lead me to venture into data visualization and web development. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the past 2 years after graduating and passing the engineering licensure exam, I have worked as a freelance data visualizer, and CAD modeler. I am a <strong class="text-xl">team player</strong> by nature and also reliable and effective in working independently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a full stack web developer. I do projects with <strong class="text-xl">Python as backend, serverless, and Vue.js/NuxtJS</strong> frontend projects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most importantly, I am an <strong class="text-xl">international volunteer</strong> helping all sorts of people to learn and benefit from <strong class="text-xl">God's Word.</strong>
